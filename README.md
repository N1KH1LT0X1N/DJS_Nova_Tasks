Summary
-------
This repository contains the completed task solutions for the DJS Nova co-comm recruitment process. Solutions are provided as Jupyter notebooks, helper scripts, and any supporting data or results. The primary language used is Jupyter Notebook / Python.

About
-----
This repository collects the solutions I developed for the DJS Nova co-comm recruitment tasks. Each solution is documented inside its notebook with explanations, code, visualizations, and results. Notebooks are organized to be readable and reproducible.

Repository layout
-----------------
Replace or confirm these paths if your structure is different:

- notebooks/               - Jupyter notebooks for each task (recommended)
- data/                    - Input datasets used by notebooks (do not include secrets)
- src/                     - Re-usable modules and helper functions
- scripts/                 - Utility scripts (data prep, evaluation, exports)
- results/                 - Generated outputs, figures, and prediction files
- requirements.txt         - Python dependencies (if present)

If you'd like, I can auto-generate the exact file list here — paste `ls -R` output or let me scan the repo and I'll fill the names and short descriptions.

Completed tasks
---------------
All assigned recruitment tasks have been completed. Below are the recorded solutions. If you want these to be expanded into a short summary for each, I can extract notebook headings and write concise descriptions.

- Task 1 — [notebook / script name goes here]
  - Short: (one-line summary)
  - Input: (dataset path)
  - Output: (artifacts produced)

- Task 2 — [notebook / script name goes here]
  - Short: (one-line summary)

(If you want me to enumerate actual filenames and create per-task descriptions, paste the repo tree or allow me to read the repo and I'll populate this section automatically.)

Requirements
------------
Minimum:
- Python 3.8+
- pip

Recommended:
- Use a virtual environment (venv or conda)

Install dependencies (if requirements.txt exists):
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # macOS / Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Common packages used:
```bash
pip install jupyterlab notebook numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nbconvert papermill
```

Setup
-----
1. Clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/N1KH1LT0X1N/DJS_Nova_Tasks.git
cd DJS_Nova_Tasks
```
2. Create & activate virtual environment and install dependencies as shown above.

Run / Reproduce
---------------
Open and run notebooks interactively:
```bash
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
```

Run a notebook headless (execute all cells) and save executed notebook:
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute notebooks/<notebook>.ipynb --output executed_<notebook>.ipynb
```

Run with parameters using papermill:
```bash
papermill notebooks/task_x.ipynb results/executed_task_x.ipynb -p param_name value
```

Evaluation & Results
--------------------
- Results, predictions, or plots generated by notebooks are saved in results/ (or the notebook-specific output folder).
- To reproduce evaluation metrics, run the evaluation script (if present):
```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py --pred results/predictions.csv --truth data/ground_truth.csv
```

Tips for reviewers
------------------
- Open the notebooks in order (if a sequence exists). Each notebook includes a short header describing the task, approach, and conclusions.
- Check the top cells for required filepath variables (DATA_DIR, RESULTS_DIR) and adapt them in your environment.
- For a quick overview of outputs, open results/ and view generated figures or the executed notebooks saved as executed_*.ipynb

Contributing
------------
This repo represents completed recruitment tasks; changes are welcome if you'd like improved documentation, additional tests, or packaging.

If you want to add collaborators:
- Add a CONTRIBUTING.md describing how to run notebooks and code style guidelines.
- For reproducibility, consider adding a requirements.txt or environment.yml.

Next steps / TODO
-----------------
- [ ] Auto-populate the Completed tasks list with actual notebook filenames and short descriptions (I can do this if you paste the repo tree or allow me to scan the repository).
- [ ] Add requirements.txt / environment.yml if missing.
- [ ] Add a CI workflow to run notebooks automatically on push/PR (I can generate a GitHub Actions workflow if desired).
- [ ] Add LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING.md.

Thanks — I prepared this README for you. If you'd like I will:
- auto-fill the task list by scanning the repository and then commit the README to a new branch (suggested name: `enhance-readme`), or
- directly update main with this README. 

Tell me which you prefer and provide any specific text you want added to the Completed tasks section (task names, one-line summaries), or paste the output of `ls -R` from the repo and I'll fill the file names automatically.
